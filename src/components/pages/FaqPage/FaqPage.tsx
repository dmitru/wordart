                create unique and attractive designs in no time even with no

              <p>
                Designs can be fully customized and downloaded in high quality

                No, you can create and download your designs without creating an

              <p>
                But having an account allows you to save your designs for later,

                it different from other word art generators?"
              id="how-is-it-different"
            >
              <p>
                Wordcloudy was created from scratch using modern technology in
                order to compete with other existing word art generators you may
                be familiar with.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's very similar in spirit to other tools (most notably
                WordArt.com), but it's more focused on the single task of
                creating amazing digital and printable designs. As such, there
                are less compromises in the design and a number of unique
                features:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Almost 1,000 of built-in fonts supporting dozens of languages
                </li>
                <li>
                  Huge searcheable collection of icons and vector shapes (custom
                  shapes are supported too, of course!)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full support for vector graphics: every design created with
                  Wordcloudy can be downloaded as an SVG vector image, offering
                  the best possible quality when printed at any resolution.
                </li>
                <li>Support for multiple document sizes</li>
                <li>
                  First-class support for filling shapes with icons (not just
                  words!)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ability to fill both shape <em>and</em> background
                </li>
                <li>And so much more!..</li>
